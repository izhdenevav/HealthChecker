The principle of the program is based on changing the shades of certain parts of the face. For proper operation of the program it is necessary to:

- Make sure that no cosmetics are applied to the area of your face under the eyes, as they may interfere with the correct operation of the program and distort the result
- Throughout the program, look clearly into the camera, do not make sudden movements of the head    
- Make sure that the camera is connected correctly and shoots at least 30 frames per second (yes, in 99% of cases the second condition is met for modern cameras, but if you doubt - it is better to check)

### Launch of the program
To run the program, run the main.py file:
```bash
python main.py
```
Profit!
